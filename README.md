A "blog list" application. It is a study assignment, made using Node Express server and React frontend.

The backend uses MongoDB cloud database to store data (using Mongoose library). The application has a token-based login system. Logged in users can view a list of blog posts and post new ones. The blog posts are deletable only by the original author. The backend implements a REST API. 

Test code is also included in this repository. Testing is done with Jest and Cypress.

Application is running here: https://chata002blogs.herokuapp.com
(Note: there is not supposed to be actual blog text or any other content in the entries)
